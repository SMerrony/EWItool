# EWItool
EWItool is an open source controller and patch editor/librarian for the popular Akai EWI4000s wind synthesizer. 

EWItool includes a fully graphical sound (patch) editor and patch library management. From version 0.4 onwards there has been access to an online patch exchange (EPX) for sharing patches with others.  For more information see our [wiki](https://github.com/SMerrony/EWItool/wiki).

EWItool has been developed by Steve Merrony. It has recently been redeveloped in Java based on lessons learnt from the original C++/Qt version.

**The new version runs - and has been tested - on recent versions of Windows, OS X and GNU/Linux.**
