# EWItool
EWItool is an open source controller for the popular Akai EWI4000s wind synthesizer. 

EWItool includes a fully graphical sound (patch) editor and patch library management. From version 0.4 onwards there has been access to an online patch exchange (EPX) for sharing patches with others.  For more information see our [wiki](https://github.com/SMerrony/EWItool2/wiki).

EWItool has been developed by Steve Merrony. It is currently being totally redeveloped in Java based on lessons learnt from the original C++/Qt version.

**EWItool is currently being redeveloped!**

*Please raise feature requests and suggestions against this project [EWItool2], not the old one.*

Once the new version has a release, the old project will be removed.
